Karma Debian package
====================

This repository contains the Debian packaging for Karma
(https://github.com/prymitive/karma).

Upstream code is (re)tagged as upstream/<version> from upstream v<version> tags
and Debian commits are made to the "master" branch.

New upstream version
====================

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/prymitive/karma
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout v<version>
  git tag upstream/<version>

  git checkout master
  git merge upstream/<version>
  dch -v<version>-1

The resulting repository should be buildable via usual means (e.g. pdebuild).
Once happy you can push/review to origin both the branch and the upstream tags.

  git push origin
  git push origin upstream/<version>
